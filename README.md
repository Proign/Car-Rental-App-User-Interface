# Car-Rental-App-User-Interface
Example of a basic user interface for a car rental company

The user interface of the car rental company includes:
– Buttons for intuitive and quick execution of requests, for accessing the New Client questionnaire, and for applying a filter to display vehicles issued and returned on a specific date, with the possibility of entering the date manually.
- Drop-down lists for intuitive and quick application of the remaining filters. When you click on the arrow on the right, you can see a dropdown menu showing all the options, and when you click on one of them, it will replace the current content.
– A window with the ability to navigate through the table obtained as a result of executing one of the queries or after applying one of the filters.
– Shortcuts for quick navigation through the interface.
